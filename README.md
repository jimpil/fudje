# fudje

## What
A tiny (24kb) Clojure library designed to offer a helping hand when testing. For those familiar with [midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje), 
you can think of think of this as 'midje-lite'. It provides the majority of features provided my midje, at a fraction of the cost 
(code-bloat, number of transitive dependencies, AOT issues etc).
In addition, fudje offers a convenient migration path away from midje, by introducing its own `fact` & `tabular` macros which
rewrite your existing midje facts into midje-free code (more on this in the intro.md). This allows for smooth & gradual migration, 
as you are, not only able to start writing new tests, but also automatically-(ish) migrating old ones. 

## For whom

This library can (potentially) be of interest to you if:

* You are looking for simple unit-testing library which supports mocking and allows you to write concise tests in a familiar syntax.
* You generally like the features offered by midje (mocking, nesting-checkers etc), but you are not overly thrilled about the syntax/complexity it introduces, and therefore wouldn't mind something less *magical*.
* You are looking for something like midje which can be AOT compiled. 
* You have a large codebase full of midje tests, and for whatever reason, you'd like to migrate away from it (without a full manual rewrite).

This library will NOT be of any interest to you if:

* You are perfectly content with vanilla clojure.test, or some other testing library.
* You never liked/appreciated midje, and even the **slightest** resemblance will put you off.


## Where
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/fudje.svg)](https://clojars.org/fudje) 

## How

* For migrating an existing test ns away from midje, you want to replace `midje.sweet` => `fudje.sweet` in the ns declaration.
* For writing brand new tests, you probably want something along these lines:

```clj 
(require '[fudje 
           [core :refer [mocking in-background]]
           [sweet :refer :all]])
```

## Example:

```clj

(defn increment [x] 
  (inc x))
  
(defn decrement [x] 
  (dec x))


(mocking [(increment 1) => (dec 1)
          (decrement 2) => 3]
          
  (is (= 0 (increment 1))) 
  (is (= 3 (decrement 2))))

=> true
  
(mocking [(increment 1) => :whatever]        
  (is (= :whatever (increment 2))))  ;; 1 failure (wrong argument passed) 

Testing arguments used in `user$increment@58d6dddc`...
**Expected arg-list: [1]
**Actual arg-list: [2]
**N-call: 1
expected: 1
  actual: (found 2 instead-of 1)

=> true
```
